## Tic-Tac-Toe With Angluar!


### Story
My first static web application, **Tic-Tac-Toe** which was written in Native Javasciprt at the time when I just start coding for one week. Manipulating DOM with Javascipt was tough at that time and did leave scars on my mind.

But...I am back with AngularJS along with proficient experiences in Code War Challenges.
